	<h1>My Learning Journal</h1>

	<h3>April 25, 2023</h3>

	<p>So far things are going well. Sometimes I worry I'll never get good at this stuff since we aren't learning a ton of new concepts every day. But at the same time I know from experience (biology course) that cramming doesn't work. Like, I can't tell you a damn thing about cells or DNA since the whole point of learning it was to pass a test.<p> 

	<p>The video standups make me feel awkward. I've never made Youtube or TikTok videos or filmed myself much at all. But I'll get used to it.<p> 

	<p>The small amount of HTMl we have done has been fun. But I can also see how it will get complicated quickly. So a bit anxious about that.<p> 

	<h3>Follow me on Substack!</h3>

	<p>I actually write stuff there semi regularly.</p>
