E4P Form Review

**Craig**

Forms are easy to find, in projects folder. Index page looks nice and links are clear, matches the rest of the site. 

Pizza Party - Not clear what the form is doing (if you hadn't read the e4p book). 

How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)

Not immediately clear what the puprose of the form is (if you hadn't read the e4p book). 

**Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?**

Yes.

**Does the form work with the expected input?**

Yes. 

**Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?**

Didn't break it.

**Is the outcome clear?**

Yes. The red highlights are good. 

**Do the form styles match across all forms?**

Not all but some. Although I don't remember that being an objective when we were making these. 

**What could be improved?**

Since there are min and max inputs for slices in each pizza this should be stated prior to entering the numbers, rather than as an error after you hit "let's party".

Took a look at Paul's drinks, quote generator, and character counting forms. Not easy to find but looks like their is a rebuild going on. I wasn't clear on what the purpose was of the drink calculator right away. The others were clear though. The forms don't match styles and could use more styling, but again, that wasn't a clearly stated objective when we made these so it's hard to criticize that. 

A couple improvements that jumped out at me:

	- I didn't like how the character counter reset back to hello as soon as I hit "calculate". 
	-The calculate button is too large for the character counter. 
	- It seems like the quote generator should return just the line with quotation marks. It also returns the author with quotes which doesn't seem right.
