E4P Form Review

**Craig**

Forms are easy to find, in projects folder. Index page looks nice and links are clear, matches the rest of the site. 

Pizza Party - Not clear what the form is doing (if you hadn't read the e4p book). 

How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)

Not immediately clear what the puprose of the form is (if you hadn't read the e4p book). 

**Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?**

Yes.

**Does the form work with the expected input?**

Yes. 

**Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?**

Didn't break it.

**Is the outcome clear?**

Yes. The red highlights are good. 

**Do the form styles match across all forms?**

Not all but some. Although I don't remember that being an objective when we were making these. 

**What could be improved?**

Since there are min and max inputs for slices in each pizza this should be stated prior to entering the numbers, rather than as an error after you hit "let's party".

**Paul**

Took a look at Paul's drinks, quote generator, and character counting forms. Not easy to find but looks like their is a rebuild going on. I wasn't clear on what the purpose was of the drink calculator right away. The others were clear though. The forms don't match styles and could use more styling, but again, that wasn't a clearly stated objective when we made these so it's hard to criticize that. 

A couple improvements that jumped out at me:

	- I didn't like how the character counter reset back to hello as soon as I hit "calculate". 
	-The calculate button is too large for the character counter. 
	- It seems like the quote generator should return just the line with quotation marks. It also returns the author with quotes which doesn't seem right.

Hunter's links are broken so I didn't get a chance to do any review. 

**Max**
Forms were easy to find. Adding some styling to the "Forms" hyperlink would help to make it more obvious it can be clicked. 

All forms are the same basic look which isn't bad. May want to put some space between the boxes on the room form. It also looks like the room form may benefit from the step attritube. Right now can only input whole numbers. For counting characters I didn't like how the cursor starts in the middle of the form. All that space around it doesn't feel right. 

**Ad**
The forms are easy to find under code section. They aren't explicitly labelled as forms, just as programming exercises, which may be a good idea. 

For character counts "Your string" isn't a very good inviation to use the counter. Could probably get rid of that text altogether or make it funny/welcoming. I'm also thinkinkg the initial size of the text area should be larger. Feels like everything is squeezed to the top of the page. I like how it repeats the input to you below the form. 

The paint form could maybe benefit by allowing half feet instead of just whole numbers. But I get that may be weird to do when there is also an input for inches. The square feet calculation may look better with the round function applied. Since the gallons output is always a whole number it may help to tell the user what logic it is using to do that.
