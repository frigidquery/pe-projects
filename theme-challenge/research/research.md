tv channel websites

# structure notes

## sites reviewed

amc, discovery, vh1, fyi, history, viceland, fxx, lifetime, rfd, reelz, trutv, travel channel, outdoor

I found that some stations try to be a resource for whatever their content is. Like foodtv has recipes, and golftv has golf stats, and travel has travel articles. I tried to stay away from those. That seems like a whole different category. 

Background images don't seem to be too popular with these sites. Maybe because they don't want to go all in on one show image and distract from others? Outdoor has some background images of like generic camoflauge. And also a funny interactive gallery of their personalities you can click on to learn more. 

FXX has an intersting background effect that is a scrolling gallery of show cards but their not interactive even though you'd think they'd be. 

Something of note is how the differnt servics choose to size the box that's either an episode, or a show card of one of their shows. Almost none use perfect squares. Most common seems to be a landscape image. Vice is the only one I saw that uses a portrait image. Seems like they're going for a movie poster or VHS box look. 

Article card typography varies a lot. name of show over, name of episode, some kind of information ("Watch Free", "Premiers Saturday"), sometiems a button to do something "Watch Preview" "Explore Now", episode synopsis. AMC has an effect where the synopsis pops up when you hover.

## Header

### content
- Many have a common theme of "here's some categories of shows we offer", i.e., Discovery Channel has Nature/Exploration/Space/Science
- Other common header links: schedule/shop/watch live/how to get/shows/
- Black header background with white letters seems most common

### style
- Black header background with white letters is a common presentation
- Out of services I looked at only RFD and Discovery had black on white header
- logo in top left
- sign in, search bar on right

## Diptych
- In the area directly after the header we're calling a diptych almost all sites universally have a large image or scrolling gallery of images (outdoor) or a video (viceland) of the show they want to encourage you to watch the most. Many have a link to start playing now (which will prompt a login first), or a link to watch on a streaming platform like Hulu. FYI has this large area broken into boxes of images of their top 3 or 4 shows. Often there is a link to the show page to find specific episodes. 

### Call to action top
- The sites that have this section usually have a link to signup for some kind of junk email updates - like for new episodes. Outdoor has a banner that encourages you to listen to articles. 

### Articles
- Getting into the real content of most these site this is where they all show you what they have to offer programming wise. Many have an effect that when you hover over the box for a show or episode it starts to pop out at you, encouraging you to click. Some have play buttons that I think are kind of trick because unless you are already logged in it doesn't really start playing anything. It'll take you somewhere else so you can pay them.

	- AMC has rows of episodes that pop out at you and the phony play button on some but not all, some rows are scrollable galleries, some arent. The categories from the top are "latest", "featured", "popular"  
	- Vh1 has a mixture of rows with one big box advertising a show, then a row of similar themed shows with a tag like "turn up the heat", then back to single boxes, then a list of free episodes to get you watching. 
	- Interstingly, I noticed vicetv has a lock signal instead of the play button on their not free episodes. Maybe the psychology is you'll see something interesting but want it more since you can't watch it right away.

### Call to action bottom
- Many, like history for instance, have section here to start a free trial. 

### footer
- Common theme is links to services owned by same network. Like history and lifetmes are part of a&e so there's links to all of their channels
- the usual social media junk that no one care about or clicks on
- many have link to "parental guidelines"
