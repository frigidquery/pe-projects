				<h2>5 Years</h2>

				<p>5 years seems like forever as a kid. Maybe because 5 years is a significant percentage of total time lived. As an adult 5 years doesn’t seem that long ago at all. I’ve lived in Denver for 10 years this Summer and 5 years from now I think I’d like to be living somewhere else. I like it here but I think you only have enough time to get to know a few cities well. Not sure where I want to go exactly but maybe a job will send me somewhere. That’s how I ended up in Denver in the first place.</p>

				<p>For my career, I’ve also been working in television for 10 years. It’s actually a great tech job because it is such a weird niche that not a lot of people have the skillset. Only problem is I’m so bored with it. I came on strong in the beginning and was determined to learn everything. I climbed the corporate ladder and earned a cushy position but now that I made it I’ve lost the motivation.</p>

				<p>As far as personal life in 5 years, I'm not sure what to do. I don’t have kids and can’t imagine ever wanting any. Never been married just because the idea of living with the same person forever sounds almost crazy to me. I’ve never not felt trapped after like more than a year of dating. Guess I just need to find the right person, as my mom would say.</p>

				<p>I would like to get a music project going again. I would say I’ve been at my happiest when I’m working on music stuff. I’d also like to get more involved in some kind of charity work. Or giving more money at the very least. Travel! I need to do this more. So far I’ve went on 3 trips this year. I think covid has made me value getting out and seeing the world more. Need to do more international trips. Related to the play more music thing, I’d like to sell my condo and buy a house. The condo is in a good location but I can’t be loud. The main thing I like about it is all the maintenance is taken care of. I have no idea how to take care of a house.</p>

				<h2>End of Course</h2>

				<p>I want to remain in tech so I’m hoping I can use the skills I’m learning at PE to pivot to a web development job maybe still in the television world. But I’m also open to something totally different. The most important part is I’m doing something I actually care about rather than just collecting a check. </p>
